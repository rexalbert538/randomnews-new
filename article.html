                <p>Frank Lampard said on Tuesday that he was “aware” of the threat from a formidable Ajax team but had
                    “confidence” in his
                    young Chelsea team ahead of Wednesday’s key Champions League clash.
                </p>

                <p>The new-look Blues, reinvigorated by an injection of youth, begin a double header with Group H
                    leaders Ajax, on
                    Wednesday.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Dutch champions rattled three goals past both lille and valencia
                    and are averaging more than three goals a game in the dutch Eredivise.
                </p>

                </ul> -->

                <p>Told jokingly by Dutch media that he looked scared, Lampard replied
                    "that's just my face".
                </p>

                </ul> -->

                <p>“I respect the team because I watched them play last year … I’m very aware of the new threats that
                    they have as a team,”
                    he said.</p>

                <p>“It’s not a factor of being scared of Ajax. We hugely respect them as a team, but we also have
                    confidence in ourselves.”</p>

                <p>Chelsea come into the Champions League match after five straight wins in all competitions, but
                    Lampard says that
                    domestic form will count for little at the Johan Cruyff Arena, especially given Chelsea’s long
                    injury list.
                </p>

                <p>Lampard confirmed that Ross Barkley and N’Golo Kante would not be fit to play on Wednesday, while
                    Antonio Rudiger is
                    also still out.</p>

                <p>“I don’t think the five wins means anything other than giving us confidence, this will be a difficult
                    challenge and we
                    need to be ready,” said Lampard, who has pushed players from Chelsea’s vaunted academy into the
                    first team this season.
                </p>

                <p>While Lampard said that he felt “pride” at the “long-deserved recognition” for the club’s youth
                    development, he insisted
                    that a transfer ban wasn’t the main reason young players such as Tammy Abraham and Fikayo Tomori
                    being pushed into the
                    limelight.
                </p>

                <p>“Everyone says we have a transfer ban and it’s the only option I have — that’s not true,” said
                    Lampard.
                </p>

                <p>“I have lots of options in the squad and I made the options on the players I think should play. I
                    believe in them. But
                    that’s not the end of the story … it’s success, in the long-term, that we have to aim for.
                </p>

                <p>“We are in a place with a history of bringing young players through and creating great teams with
                    young players over the
                    years and we have a long way to go.”
                </p>

                <p>One of those players is Tomori, who faces the unenviable task of trying to stop a multi-pronged Ajax
                    attack that will
                    feature former injury doubt Hakim Ziyech, scorer of an astonishing goal last time at Valencia
                </p>

                <p>
                    The flamboyant Dutch champions are on the hunt for European success after a thrilling run to the
                    semi-finals last
                    season, which captured the continent’s imagination. They are possibly the biggest test yet for
                    Lampard’s fledgling team.
                </p>

                <p>
                    “Both teams are coming into the game with good form and it’s a big game in the group. Ajax are such
                    a big club with
                    great history,” said Tomori, who is confident Chelsea are up to the task.
                </p>

                <p>“I don’t think we can put a limit on ourselves. We’re in good form, and we’re trying to continue that
                    throughout the
                    season in every competition. We want to carry on going.”
