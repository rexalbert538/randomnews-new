            </h1>
            <span class="date">25<sup>th</sup> October,2019</span>

            <div class="article-body">
                <p>The 38-year-old, whose contract expires in December, scored as his side lost 5-3 in the Western Conference semi-final.</p>

                <p>Ex-Arsenal forward Carlos Vela scored twice in the first half to take his season's tally for LA FC to 36.</p>

                <p>Galaxy fought back through Ibrahimovic, but Adama Diomande's late double secured LA FC's victory.</p>

                <p>It is the first time LA FC have beaten Galaxy in the MLS - a rivalry nicknamed 'El Trafico' because of California's
                traffic congestion.</p>

                <p>Ibrahimovic, who has been linked with a return to Europe, appeared to grab his crotch as he was heckled by fans as he
                left the field</p>

                <p>"They said something. [I'm] not being disrespectful, but this is like training for me," Ibrahimovic said of the
                incident.</p>

                <p>"The stadium is too small for me. This is a walk in the park."</p>

                <p>His second-half equaliser dragged the scores to 2-2, before Diego Rossi and substitute Diomande reasserted LA FC's lead.</p>

                <p>Galaxy defender Rolf Feltscher gave Galaxy late hope, but Diomande chipped in his second with 10 minutes remaining.</p>

                <p>LA FC will now face Seattle Sounders for a place in the final against either Atlanta United or Toronto</p>

                <p>"If I stay it will be good for MLS because the whole world will watch it," Ibrahimovic added.</p>

                <p>"If I don't stay, nobody will remember what MLS is.</p>
