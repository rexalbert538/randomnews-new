                <p>Bitcoin prices approached $7,000 earlier today, reaching a more-than five-month low as traders
                    responded to concerns
                    about regulatory intervention</p>

                <p>The digital currency fell to $7,307.39 around noon EST, its lowest since May 18,<a
                        href="https://www.coindesk.com/">CoinDesk</a> figures show</p>

                <p>At this point, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value had lost nearly half of its value
                    since reaching
                    nearly $14,000 in June, additional CoinDesk data reveals.</p>

                <p>[Ed note: Investing in cryptocoins or tokens is highly speculative and the market is largely
                    unregulated. Anyone
                    considering it should be prepared to lose their entire investment.]</p>



                <h3 class="subtitle">‘Increased Regulatory Scrutiny’ Fuels Losses</h3>

                <p>The digital currency suffered sharp declines this morning, falling close to 7% in less than three
                    hours leading up to
                    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s scheduled testimony before the United States House of Representatives
                    Committee on
                    Financial Services.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin was trading lower today at a time when the broader cryptocurrency was suffering widespread
                    losses, with every
                    single digital asset tracked on the CoinDesk website being in the red at the time of this writing.
                </p>

                <p>Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of asset manager <a href="http://www.arcafunds.com/">Arca</a>,
                    stated that “increased regulatory scrutiny” drove the sale
                    of many different cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <p>Marouane Garcon, managing director of crypto-to-crypto derivatives platform <a
                        href="https://www.tradeamulet.com/">Amulet</a>, also weighed in on this matter.</p>

                <p>“I would definitely say that market uncertainty is due to unfavorable regulatory conversation,” he
                    stated.</p>

                <p>“I think there’s more negative news than positive surrounding cryptocurrencies right now,” added
                    Garcon.</p>

                <p>“Governments are finally being forced to talk about how it can impact their monetary policies.”</p>

                <h3 class="subtitle">Bearish Market Factors</h3>

                <p>In addition to speaking to the latest regulatory developments, analysts emphasized that several other
                    variables helped
                    exacerbate today’s losses</p>

                <p>Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager <a
                        href="https://www.bitbullcapital.com/">BitBull Capital</a>, noted the key role played by
                    leveraged bets.</p>

                <p>“This morning’s move was very similar to the September drop, with many longs liquidated and overly
                    optimistic crypto
                    investors getting caught holding the bag,” he stated.</p>

                <p>Dorman also weighed in, stressing that “a lack of positive catalysts coupled with very low trading
                    volumes that makes
                    every move lower an order of magnitude higher than you’d expect.”</p>

                <p>However, while trading activity on exchanges may be low, the data provided by these marketplaces may
                    not tell the whole
                    story, said Garcon.</p>

                <p>“Trading volumes are low across spot exchanges but DeFi are achieving record highs,” he stated.</p>

                <p>“So I think the money is just migrating to something more stable in a time of uncertainty.”</p>

                <p>Further, while several analysts pointed to leverage as helping fuel bitcoin’s recent losses, the
                    current market
                    conditions could also facilitate compelling gains.</p>

                <p>“The proliferation of derivatives cuts both ways,” noted Christopher Brookins, founder and CIO at <a
                        href="https://www.valiendero.io/">Valiendero Digital
                        Assets</a>.</p>

                <p>“If momentum reverses or an unexpected catalyst unfolds, price is likely to experience a similarly
                    rapid leap back
                    towards prior resistance levels in mid to late-Q4.”</p>
