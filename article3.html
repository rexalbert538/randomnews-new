                <p>A Federal High Court in Lagos has fixed Nov. 5 for hearing in a suit filed by a Nigerian Musician,
                    Olumuyiwa Danladi
                    a.k.a Danny Young, against fellow Music star, Tiwatope Savage, over alleged copyright infringement.
                </p>

                <p>In the suit, labelled FHC/L/CS/230/2019 and pending before Justice Mohammed Liman, Young is claiming
                    N205 million in
                    damages against Savage for allegedly, using his Musical work titled ‘ONE’ without lawful authority.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The ‘Omo Lepa’ hit singer filed the suit through his counsel, Mr. Justin Ige, of Creative Legal,
                    claiming the sum of
                    N200 million in damages against the defendants for copyright violation
                </p>

                <p>He is also claiming N5 million as cost of action, as well as demanding an account for profits accrued
                    to the defendants
                    from the use of the infringing musical work titled ‘ONE
                </p>

                <p>Although the Plaintiff filed the suit since Feb. 13, the defendants failed to file any response to
                    the suit.
                </p>

                <p>The court has consequently, now set down the suit for definite hearing on Nov. 5
                </p>

                <p>Plaintiff is seeking a declaration, that by copying, recording, reproducing and broadcasting his
                    musical composition and
                    melody without his authorisation, the defendants have infringed on his copyright
                </p>


                <p>He is seeking a declaration that by copying, performing, and distributing literary work and music
                    lyrics authored and
                    owned by him without lawful authority, the defendants have infringed on his copyright
                </p>

                <p>He, therefore, seeks an order of perpetual injunction restraining the defendants, whether by themselves or their agents,
                from further copying, performing, recording, reproducing, or communicating to the public, his musical composition.
                </p>
